<title>Emacs Integration for Fossil</title>

This mini-project is for integrating emacs into fossil.  This needs a
few changes into fossil and needs a new file to be loaded into emacs.

You need emacs version 23.1 or better.  This definitely does not work
with versions 22.*.

<h4>How Do I load Fossil support into emacs?</h4>

Short answer:

Add this to your .emacs file, or cut and paste this into the *scratch*
buffer and do
<code>C-x C-e</code> to execute it.

<pre>
(add-to-list 'vc-handled-backends 'Fossil)
(load-file "/path/to/this/project/vc/el/vc-fossil.el")
</pre>
or if you would rather load the file lazily, compile the file (see
below) and use this instead.
<pre>
(add-to-list 'vc-handled-backends 'Fossil)
(autoload 'vc-fossil-registered "/path/to/this/project/vc/el/vc-fossil.elc")
</pre>

To compile the file (with warnings) do the following
<pre>
emacs -batch -q -no-site-file -eval '(byte-compile-file "vc-fossil.el")'
</pre>
then you can load vc-fossil.elc, which should be nominally faster.

<h4>What changes to fossil are required</h4>

As of this fossil version:

<pre>
7d2d1d3228232b1a1434e425f11008c043171263 2010-11-09 17:51:35 UTC
</pre>

Fossil trunk (and therefore binaries after that date) support
this package directly.

Future changes, if required, will be in the venks-emacs branch on the
fossil repository.


<h4>What emacs keys do I need?</h4>

This integrates fossil into emacs vc builtin mode.  The same keys will
work for fossil inside a fossil tree as for other scms outside.

A few are:

<table>
<tr><td><code>C-x v d</code></td><td>Run Fossil dired - like cvs-examine</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>C-x v l</code></td><td>When in a file, show log</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>v</code></td><td>In VC, do next action: merge/update/checkin</td></tr>
</table>

</table>
